introduce the current industry standard memory allocators (general-purpose and specialized), their design and implementation. review real world problems and their respective solutions, where application performance was significantly hindered or complex bugs were introduced.

The audience will walk away with knowledge of (sometimes surprising) anti-patterns to avoid when making use of dynamic memory allocation, and new technologies and techniques to use for improving performance and reliability. 

We will investigate cases where the general purpose allocator interface fails, and when alternatives are better. Finally, we will reinforce our new-found understanding of some basic memory allocator internals to improve our ability to investigate and root cause heap corruption bugs that would otherwise take hours (sometimes even weeks) to fix.
